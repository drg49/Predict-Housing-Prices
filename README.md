# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This project uses a regression model to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and more. It is built in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages popular data science libraries including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates home sale prices using a dataset of housing information from Washington State.

### Key Objectives:

- Understand the data through exploration and visualization
- Preprocess and clean the dataset (handle nulls, encode categories, transform skewed data)
- Train and evaluate regression models
- Optimize model performance
- Interpret model results and feature importance
